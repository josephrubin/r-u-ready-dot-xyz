abrt_retrace_worker_selinux - Security Enhanced Linux Policy for the abrt_retrace_worker processes

Description


 
Security-Enhanced Linux secures the abrt_retrace_worker processes via flexible mandatory access control.

The abrt_retrace_worker processes execute with the abrt_retrace_worker_t SELinux type. You can check if you have these processes running by executing the ps command with the -Z qualifier.

For example:

ps -eZ | grep abrt_retrace_worker_t

Entrypoints

The abrt_retrace_worker_t SELinux type can be entered via the "abrt_retrace_worker_exec_t" file type. The default entrypoint paths for the abrt_retrace_worker_t domain are the following:"

/usr/bin/abrt-retrace-worker, /usr/bin/retrace-server-worker

Process Types

SELinux defines process types (domains) for each process running on the system

You can see the context of a process using the -Z option to ps

Policy governs the access confined processes have to files. SELinux abrt_retrace_worker policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their abrt_retrace_worker processes in as secure a method as possible.

The following process types are defined for abrt_retrace_worker:

abrt_retrace_worker_t

Note: semanage permissive -a abrt_retrace_worker_t

can be used to make the process type abrt_retrace_worker_t permissive. Permissive process types are not denied access by SELinux. AVC messages will still be generated.

File Contexts

SELinux requires files to have an extended attribute to define the file type.

You can see the context of a file using the -Z option to ls

Policy governs the access confined processes have to these files. SELinux abrt_retrace_worker policy is very flexible allowing users to setup their abrt_retrace_worker processes in as secure a method as possible.

The following file types are defined for abrt_retrace_worker:

abrt_retrace_worker_exec_t

- Set files with the abrt_retrace_worker_exec_t type, if you want to transition an executable to the abrt_retrace_worker_t domain.

Note: File context can be temporarily modified with the chcon command. If you want to permanently change the file context you need to use the semanage fcontext command. This will modify the SELinux labeling database. You will need to use restorecon to apply the labels.

Managed Files

The SELinux process type abrt_retrace_worker_t can manage files labeled with the following file types. The paths listed are the default paths for these file types. Note the processes UID still need to have DAC permissions.

abrt_retrace_spool_t

/var/spool/abrt-retrace(/.*)?

/var/spool/retrace-server(/.*)?

initrc_tmp_t
mnt_t

/mnt(/[^/]*)

/mnt(/[^/]*)?

/rhev(/[^/]*)?

/media(/[^/]*)

/media(/[^/]*)?

/etc/rhgb(/.*)?

/media/.hal-.*

/net

/afs

/misc

/rhev

tmp_t
/tmp

/usr/tmp

/var/tmp

/var/tmp/vi.recover

Commands

semanage fcontext can also be used to manipulate default file context mappings.

semanage permissive can also be used to manipulate whether or not a process type is permissive.

semanage module can also be used to enable/disable/install/remove policy modules.

system-config-selinux is a GUI tool available to customize SELinux policy settings.
